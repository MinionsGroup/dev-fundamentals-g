Mathematical model 

If we have the coordinates X1,Y1(1,1) and X2, Y2 (3,3), we have to find the area of triangle rectangle that is composed for that straight line (it corresponds to the hypotenuse of that triangle) 
Initially we need to project the coordinates x3,y3 in order to find base and height of the triangle rectangle 
X3 = X2 
Y3= Y1 
Then we find: 
- The distance between the point P1(x1,y1) and P3(x3,y3), this distance is the base - The distance between the point P2(x2,y2) and P3(x3,y3), this distance is the height 
For that we use this formule: 

d = v (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 

Finally we need to find the area: 
A = b * h / 2

Algorithm 
	Input (x1, y1, x2, y2): isTriangle 
	If isTriangle is true: 
		Project point 3, getCordinates (x2 , y1 ) : x3, y3 
		Find base, getDistance(x1, y1, x3, y3): distance 
		Find height, getDistance(x2, y2, x3, y3): distance 
		Find area, getArea(base, height): area 
		Show area, show(area) 
	 Else: 
		  Print “Those coordinates cannot form a triangle” 


Input(x1,y1,x2,y2):isTriangle 
 isTriangle = true 
 If x1 = x2 or y1=y2 
  isTriangle=false 


getCoordinates(x , y): x3,y3 
 x3=x 
 y3=y 
 
getDistance(x1, y1, x2, y2):distance 
 x_member= x2 – x1 
 x_member=x_member * x_member 
 y_member= y2 – y1 
 y_member= y_member * y_member 
 distance=v (x_member + y_member)
  
getArea(base, height): area 
 area = (base * height)/2 
 
show(area) 
 print “The area is” + are
