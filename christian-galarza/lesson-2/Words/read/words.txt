How Gaia will map the galaxy one star at a time

The astronomy community is preparing for a big one: a spectacular, 3D map of the entire Milky Way.

Astronomy is often called the oldest branch of science. Since ancient times, humans have stared at the sky,
 cataloged its residents, marked new arrivals, and charted the constant stars and wandering planets.

Over millennia, huge advances have been made in astronomy, but some surprisingly basic questions remain:
 Where exactly are the stars? Where, in the grand scheme of things, is Earth? What is the shape and
 structure of our home galaxy?

We’ve come a long way from thinking of the stars as a two-dimensional projection on the sky, but measuring
a star’s distance remains quite tricky. And even tracking a star’s motion across the sky in two dimensions
 is difficult without years of data.

In 1989, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched the Hipparcos satellite to measure the positions
of 2.5 million stars, a catalog that wasn’t released in full until 2000. In 2013, ESA launched Gaia,
which will return even higher-precision data on over a billion stars. Gaia was a Greek goddess who was
 regarded as a sort of Mother Earth. The ESA mission originally stood for “Global Astrometric
 Interferometer for Astrophysics.” Though many of the parameters changed, ESA kept the name for
 mission continuity.

Gaia won’t complete its mission until 2019, and the final data analysis won’t be available until years
afterward. But in September 2015, the Gaia science team released a first round of data from 14 months
of observing, and welcomed scientists around the globe to jump in. The results are already changing
astronomers’ perspective of our galaxy.
By the numbers
Gaia’s mission statement is to “map a billion stars,” but even this bold promise undersells the space
observatory’s true abilities. Gaia, orbiting around 932,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) away and
mapping the whole sky, carries three instruments. Its astrometric instrument charts positions and motions
of stars with pinpoint precision by observing how they appear to move over the course of Gaia’s five-year
mission. Its photometric camera measures the brightness of stars at both red and blue wavelengths, producing
 data about their temperatures and compositions. Finally, the spectrometer measures the Doppler shift
  of particular chemical signatures to reveal whether stars are moving toward or away from Earth.

   “How Gaia will map a billion stars.”)

Eventually, Gaia’s goal is to plot the distance of 100 million stars to better than 10 percent accuracy.
 For 10 million objects, its margin of error will be less than 1 percent. It will measure the positions
 and motions of more than 1 billion stars across the whole sky, down to 20th magnitude, with an accuracy
  of a few millionths of an arcsecond, crushing previous surveys.

For this first data release, though, Gaia needed some help. Gaia measures the motions of stars to
determine their distance. From only the first year of data, it’s impossible to untangle the motion
of the stars from the telescope’s own motion as it follows Earth’s orbit around the Sun. But the
Hipparcos satellite has already done this work once, for millions of Gaia’s target stars.
 The Hipparcos catalog knows where these stars were 20 years ago, and Gaia knows where they
 are now, to even better precision. That extended timeline was just what Gaia needed.

So the Gaia team combined the final Hipparcos catalog, called Hipparcos-Tycho 2, with Gaia’s
data thus far. The Tycho-Gaia Astrometric Solution (TGAS) is the first step in an updated map
that will eventually contain a star’s position in 3-D, plus its motion, more accurately than
ever before. For now, it contains 2 million stars, measured twice as precisely as by Hipparcos
alone. By the end of Gaia’s mission, the Hipparcos data will be superseded by Gaia’s more precise
 measurements. But in the meantime, Hipparcos — and a few other surprising sources — are lending
  Gaia a helping hand.
