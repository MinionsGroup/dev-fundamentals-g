What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a OOPs concept where one name can have many forms.
 For example, you have a smartphone for communication. The communication mode you choose could be anything.
It can be a call, a text message, a picture message, mail, etc. So, the goal is common that is communication,
but their approach is different. This is called Polymorphism.
 What is Dynamic Polymorphism?
Dynamic Polymorphism is the mechanism by which multiple methods can be defined with same name and signature
in the superclass and subclass. The call to an overridden method are resolved at run time.
