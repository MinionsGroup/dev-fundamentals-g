Leap year

Inputs
p, q, r

Model mathematic-logic
p is divisible by 4
q is not divisible by 100
r is divisible by 400
where p, q and r are the year

p ^ (~q v r)

Algorithm

Is leap Year
1.	Read year.
2.	Is year divisible by 400. year : p
3.	Is year divisible by 4. year : r
4.	Is year not divisible by 100. year : q
5.	If p : is Leap Year
else if r and q : is Leap Year
else : Is not Leap Year

Is year divisible by a number : true/false
1.	Read year
2.	quotient  = Year/number
3.	if quotient * number == Year : true
else false
